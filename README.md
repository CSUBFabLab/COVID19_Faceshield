# COVID19_Faceshield
Face shield files for 3D printing and laser cutting in order to assist the California State University Bakersfield Fab Lab. These will be given as donations to Kern Public Health.
Most recent release is available here:

# Print:
PETG: The Quadro RC3 headband file is best, if your printer is large enough to fit it. Otherwise print the RC1 headband file which is slightly smaller.

PLA: The Bottom Support provides some rigidity to the face shield, and the PLA is a little stiffer than PETG. This is a minimalist design that prints very quickly as compared to the original Prusa design.
