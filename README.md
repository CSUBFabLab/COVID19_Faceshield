# COVID19_Faceshield
Face shield files for 3D printing and laser cutting in order to assist the California State University Bakersfield Fab Lab. These will be given as donations to Kern Public Health.

Most recent release is available here: https://github.com/CSUBFabLab/COVID19_Faceshield/releases/latest

# Instructions:

Download the latest release and unzip the folder.

Using PETG filament print one of the Headband A3D files (single, x2, or x6 depending on your machine size).

Print settings we have used: Support off, Raft off, Nozzle 230C-265C (depending on your printer's abilities), Bed ~70C, Layer Height 0.3mm, 4 perimeters, 0% infill.

Print surface: Painters tape with glue stick (tested on cold bed), glass with hair spray (tested on heated bed), glass with glue stick (tested on bed at 80C)

  Android's 3D designed the A3D headband files.

Unnecessary for others at this time but included for completeness, the bottom reinforcement can be printed out of PLA. This is a minimalist design that prints very quickly as compared to the original Prusa design. The Fab Lab has enough printers making these currently. We only need help with the headbands.

Also included for completeness is the template for the clear shield. It is designed to fit on a 24"x12" laser cutter.

Original source for the files in the outdated folder: https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/25857-prusa-protective-face-shield-rc2 however the RC3 Improved version is modified by Android's 3D to have no sidwall text and is only available here.
