# COVID19_Faceshield
Face shield files for 3D printing and laser cutting in order to assist the California State University Bakersfield Fab Lab. These will be given as donations to Kern Public Health.

Most recent release is available here: https://github.com/CSUBFabLab/COVID19_Faceshield/releases/latest

# Instructions:

Download the latest release and unzip the folder.

Using PETG filament print the Headband RC3 Quad Improved file, if it will fit on your printer. If it will not fit, print the Headband RC1 file which is slightly smaller. The RC3 design is much preferred over the RC1.

Print settings we have used: Support off, Raft off, Nozzle 230C-260C (depending on your printer's abilities), Bed ~60C, Layer Height 0.3mm, 4 perimeters, 0% infill.

Print surface: Painters tape with glue stick (tested on cold bed), glass with hair spray (tested on heated bed)

Unnecessary for others at this time but included for completeness, the bottom reinforcement can be printed out of PLA. This is a minimalist design that prints very quickly as compared to the original Prusa design. The Fab Lab has enough printers making these currently. We only need help with the headbands.

Also included for completeness is the template for the clear shield. It is designed to fit on a 24"x12" laser cutter.
